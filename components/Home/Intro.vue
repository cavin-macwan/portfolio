      Hello!
    </h1>
    <p class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-400">
      I'm Cavin Macwan, a Mobile Architect, Indie Developer, and Co-Founder of <a href="https://meticha.com"
        target="_blank" class="underline">Meticha</a>, where we don't just debug software‚Äîwe debug life's technological
      complexities. With over 5 years of turning caffeine into code via Android, Jetpack Compose, and Flutter, I
      specialize in apps that perform so well they make servers blush. üì±‚ú®
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-400">
      As the lead app developer at 7Span, I spend my days creating UIs so intuitive even your grandparents would swipe
      right. When I'm not caught in an infinite loop of problem-solving, I'm contributing to GitHub (where my commits
      are cleaner than my apartment), crafting tools like Compose101, and mentoring developers who still think
      semicolons are optional. üé§
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-400">
      My error logs say I also give talks that are exception-ally good, sharing resources with zero null pointer
      exceptions(huh Kotlin). Join me as we navigate the deprecated methods of yesterday and build the overridden
      functions of tomorrow. Remember: in my world, there are only 10 types of people‚Äîthose who understand binary and
      those who have a social life. üåç
